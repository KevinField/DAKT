# DAKT
DialAKneeThing is a lightning-fast, exploration-based hierarchy viewer, meant to scale from personal bookmarks all the way up to a replacement for large corporate web sites' nav pages / site maps.

What is A Knee Thing?  It's a terrible pun for "anything", with connotations of being fast, like a knee-jerk reaction, but hopefully without the negative connotations of that phrase.  In any case, it's meant to help people organize arbitrary hierarchies of URIs, while making them very quick to explore and access.  The URIs can be static or dynamic, but DAKT blazes with static URIs in particular.
